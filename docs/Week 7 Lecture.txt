        <h3><strong>Introduction: The Logic of "Interruption"</strong></h3>
        <p>Let&rsquo;s think back to weeks 3 and 4, and remember why running basic regressions on observational, cross-sectional data&mdash;data that compares lots of units at one single point in time&mdash;often struggles to give us strong causal answers.</p>
        <p>When we do this, different units (cities, agencies, states, people) are almost never truly comparable. They differ in seemingly countless ways (history, resources, leadership, priorities, etc.), right? So when we compare them using cross-sectional regression, it becomes hard to know whether differences in outcomes are caused by the variable we care about or by all the other ways the units differ. On top of that, because cross-sectional data gives us only one &ldquo;snapshot&rdquo; (a peak at how X and Y relate to each other at one point in time) we can&rsquo;t see what happened before or how X and Y move over time. That makes it hard to tell whether X caused Y, Y caused X, or whether something else created the pattern altogether.</p>
        <p>Last week, we saw that Regression Discontinuity-based designs gave us one way to escape these problems: instead of comparing units that are very different, we structure the comparison around a cutoff that splits units into two nearly identical groups. The cutoff helps us get closer to a &ldquo;like to like&rdquo; comparison, making our causal claims more credible.</p>
        <p>Interrupted Time Series (ITS) works super similarly, but it uses a different cutoff mechanism: <strong>time</strong>. Instead of comparing different units, ITS compares a single unit&mdash;such as a city, agency, school district, or state&mdash;to <strong>itself</strong> over time. The key idea is simple: if something important happens at a known point in time (like a new law, a major policy reform, or a sudden program launch), we can treat that moment as a cutoff. Then we look to see whether the trend in the outcome changes right when the intervention occurs.</p>
        <p>This is why we say ITS uses time as the &ldquo;running variable&rdquo; (think back to the RD modules). In RD, the running variable was something like population or income, and the cutoff was a specific value (and then we compared units at the edges of those cutoffs). In ITS, the running variable is time itself, and the cutoff is the date (or moment) when the intervention happened. We look closely at what happens to the dependent variable just before and just after that date. If it rapidly shoots off in a direction, or the direction shifts entirely, then chances are, it was the result of that &ldquo;interruption&rdquo; (the law, policy, program) in the dataset.</p>
        <p>Why does this help us? Because comparing a unit to itself removes many of the differences that create trouble in cross-sectional work. A city&rsquo;s political culture, an agency&rsquo;s leadership style, a community&rsquo;s demographics&mdash;those things may matter, but they don&rsquo;t change sharply on the day a new policy is introduced. So they&rsquo;re unlikely to be mistaken for the effect of the policy. In other words, all the stable characteristics of the unit &ldquo;cancel out,&rdquo; letting us focus on how the outcome changes over time.</p>
        <p>Another advantage is that ITS lets us see <em>trends</em>, not just levels. With cross-sectional data, we can&rsquo;t tell where the unit was heading. But with ITS, we can. If a city&rsquo;s crime rate has been flat for five years and then suddenly drops when a new policing strategy begins, that shift is meaningful. ITS gives us this context.</p>
        <p>So the big picture is this: ITS is a method that uses time to create a clearer comparison<strong>.</strong> <strong><em>Instead of comparing different units that may be wildly different, we compare one unit to itself, track what it was doing before the intervention, and then ask whether that trajectory changed when the intervention occurred</em></strong>. It doesn&rsquo;t solve every problem, and it only works when something meaningful happens at a clearly identifiable time. But when those conditions are met, ITS provides a powerful way to learn from observational data without relying on unrealistic assumptions or complicated statistical fixes<span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;">.</span></p>

        <h3><strong>What an Interrupted Time Series Is (and Isn&rsquo;t)</strong></h3>
        <p>ITS is one of the most intuitive designs we&rsquo;ll cover this semester because it reflects how practitioners, policymakers, and analysts often think in the real world: something important happened at a specific moment, and we want to know whether it changed the outcome we care about. The core idea is ever so simple. If we measure the same unit repeatedly over time and we know exactly when an intervention occurred, we can check whether the trend in the outcome changed at that moment.</p>
        <p>This means ITS is fundamentally an &ldquo;intervention design&rdquo;.<strong><em> It only works well when something meaningful and clearly timed happened&mdash;something that could reasonably &ldquo;interrupt&rdquo; the existing pattern</em></strong>. Examples include: a new law or regulation taking effect, a city implementing a major program, a state banning a product, a police department adopting body-worn cameras, or a health system rolling out a new procedure or technology. These are all events that start at a known time and could plausibly change behavior or outcomes quickly enough for us to detect.</p>
        <p>Because of this, ITS is <strong>not</strong> a general-purpose tool for answering every kind of research question. Many topics we might be interested in&mdash;like how political ideology affects policy attitudes, how race or class shapes trust in government, or whether community demographics drive service use&mdash;do not involve a sharp moment when something changes. They are about slow-moving differences between units, not sudden shocks within a single unit. ITS is simply not built for this. It is designed for situations where an intervention &ldquo;turns on&rdquo; at a clear moment in time and we have enough observations before and after that moment to see whether the outcome shifts.</p>
        <p>A second key feature of ITS is that time itself functions as the running variable. In Regression Discontinuity, the running variable was something like age, income, or test score, and the cutoff occurred where a rule changed. In ITS, the running variable is time, and the cutoff is the moment when the policy or event began. Everything hinges on what happens at that moment. We look to see whether the outcome jumps up or down (a level change), and whether the direction or speed of the trend shifts (a slope change). This is why the design is called &ldquo;interrupted&rdquo;&mdash;the existing pattern is interrupted by the intervention.</p>
        <p>When the intervention is real and well-defined, this comparison is incredibly powerful. We can look at how the outcome was moving before the intervention (the pre-trend), treat that as our baseline, and then ask whether the pattern afterward looks meaningfully different. If a city&rsquo;s ER wait times were stable for years and then drop immediately after a new triage system is implemented, that shift is evidence of impact. The design doesn&rsquo;t require comparison units or complicated assumptions about how different units relate to one another. It simply relies on the idea that the pre-intervention trend is our best prediction of what would have happened if the intervention had not occurred<span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;">.</span></p>

        <h3><strong>Some Real-World Policy Examples&nbsp;</strong></h3>
        <p>Alright, given that ITS is a powerful tool that can ONLY be used in specific circumstances&mdash;those in which we have time series data on a single unit and where an intervention is clearly imposed that impacts the dependent variable&mdash;let&rsquo;s think about real policy situations where it could be applicable.&nbsp; In each example below, notice two features:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>the moment the intervention starts is clear, and</li>
            <li>the intervention is strong enough that it could realistically change the outcome we&rsquo;re tracking.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>When both conditions are met, ITS becomes an appealing design.</p>
        <h4><strong>Example 1: A City Adopts a 911 Triage System</strong></h4>
        <p>Imagine a city launches a new triage system that routes non-emergency calls to alternative responders beginning January 1, 2022. We have monthly call-volume data from 2017 to 2024.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><em>Before the intervention:</em> call volume is high and stable.</li>
            <li><em>After the intervention:</em> calls drop immediately and continue decreasing.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This is a classic ITS scenario: we have a clear &ldquo;on&rdquo; date and a policy that could plausibly shift outcomes right away.</p>
        <h4><strong>Example 2: A State Implements a Flavored Vape Ban</strong></h4>
        <p>Suppose a state bans flavored vaping products on July 1, 2020. We have quarterly data on youth vaping rates from 2010&ndash;2023.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If the trend suddenly levels off or declines at the ban date, ITS helps us interpret whether the policy is responsible.</li>
            <li>If the trend continues unchanged, it suggests the ban did not move behavior.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Again, the policy is well-timed and strong enough that we might expect a noticeable change.</p>
        <h4><strong>Example 3: A Police Department Requires Body Cameras</strong></h4>
        <p>Say a department mandates body cameras beginning in March 2018. We track monthly use-of-force incidents from 2008&ndash;2022.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use-of-force rates often change quickly if cameras alter officer or civilian behavior.</li>
            <li>The mandate is a clear intervention point.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This is another situation where the &ldquo;before&rdquo; trend provides a baseline and the &ldquo;after&rdquo; window allows us to see whether the outcome shifted.</p>
        <h4><strong>Why These Examples Work (and Why Others Don&rsquo;t)</strong></h4>
        <p>Across all three examples, the logic is the same:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A BIG OLE change happened at a specific moment.</li>
            <li>That moment can reasonably cause an immediate or gradual shift in the outcome.</li>
            <li>We have enough pre- and post-intervention data to observe a trend.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This is exactly the kind of setting where ITS kills it.</p>
        <p>But it also illustrates what ITS cannot do. These examples are <strong>not</strong> slow-moving structural relationships like:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>does ideology influence support for environmental policy?</li>
            <li>do racial disparities shape trust in government?</li>
            <li>do wealthier communities use fewer public services?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Those questions involve differences <em>between</em> units, not sudden shifts <em>within</em> a single unit over time. Without a sharp intervention moment, ITS is simply not the right design.</p>

        <h3><strong>Formalizing the Design: How it Works</strong></h3>
        <p>Now that we&rsquo;ve built a strong intuition for what an ITS design looks like and when it is appropriate, we can walk through its formal structure. Even though the model contains several moving pieces, it is much more intuitive once you see how each part connects back to the simple idea we&rsquo;ve been emphasizing: <em>time is our running variable, and the intervention date is our cutoff.</em></p>
        <h4><strong>Time as the Running Variable</strong></h4>
        <p>Just like Regression Discontinuity relied on a continuous running variable such as income or test scores, ITS uses <strong>time</strong> as the running variable. Every observation occurs at a specific time point, and the intervention divides the timeline into two segments: <em>before</em> and <em>after</em> the policy began.</p>
        <p>In practice, we construct three simple variables:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>time</strong> &mdash; a continuous count of time units (months, weeks, years). This isn&rsquo;t the &ldquo;date&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s the observation number. It starts with &ldquo;1&rdquo; (observation 1) and continues on up</li>
            <li><strong>post</strong> &mdash; an indicator that equals 1 after the intervention begins and 0 before it</li>
            <li><strong>time &times; post</strong> &mdash; an interaction term that allows the slope to change after the intervention</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These three pieces give us the ability to detect both an immediate shift in the outcome and a change in the long-term trajectory.</p>
        <h4><strong>The Standard ITS Regression Model</strong></h4>
        <p>The typical model used for single-unit ITS resembles a straightforward extension of a linear trend:</p>
        <p style="text-align: center; background-color: #ffffff; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #ccc; font-family: monospace; font-size: 1.1em;">Y<sub>t</sub> = &alpha; + &beta;<sub>1</sub>(time) + &beta;<sub>2</sub>(post) + &beta;<sub>3</sub>(time &times; post) + &epsilon;<sub>t</sub></p>
        <p>Though it looks more complex than a basic regression, each part has a specific&mdash;and intuitive&mdash;interpretation.</p>
        <h4><strong>What Each Coefficient Means</strong></h4>
        <p>To make sense of the model, it helps to interpret each coefficient in terms of the story we&rsquo;re trying to tell about the policy.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>&alpha; (alpha)</strong> &mdash; the starting level of the outcome at time 0</li>
            <li><strong>&beta;₁ (time)</strong> &mdash; the pre-intervention trend</li>
            <ul>
                <li><em>How was the outcome changing before the policy?</em></li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>&beta;₂ (post)</strong> &mdash; the immediate jump or drop when the intervention starts</li>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Does the outcome shift right when the policy begins?</em></li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>&beta;₃ (time &times; post)</strong> &mdash; the change in slope after the intervention</li>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Does the trend speed up, slow down, or reverse direction?</em></li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>These pieces together allow the model to capture both level changes and slope changes, which is what makes ITS flexible enough to evaluate many types of policies.</p>
        <h4><strong>Visualizing the Components</strong></h4>
        <p>The graph below visualizes the components above.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>B0 on the graph stands in for our alpha (sorry, we <em>borrowed</em> the figure and they use different notations). the starting level of the outcome at time 0.</li>
            <li>As we see, B1 demonstrates the trend in the outcome variable over time PRIOR to the intervention.</li>
            <li>B2, demonstrates whether and to what extent the outcome &ldquo;jumps&rdquo; as a result of the intervention. Sometimes an intervention will cause a steep jump (a ban on cigarette sales, would cause a dramatic impact on cigarette sales for instance!). Sometimes, we expect no jump, but rather a gradual change in slope.
                <ul>
                    <li>In the represented graph, we see that the intervention caused an immediate decrease in the dependent variable.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>B3 represents the change in the slope from what we would have expected to see had the intervention not occurred (we assume the slope would have stayed constant), and where it is now.
                <ul>
                    <li>In the included graph, we see that there was a strong positive slope prior to the intervention, and now, there is a much less steep but still positive slope. So, not only did the intervention cause a steep, immediate drop, it also slowed the positive growth projection.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3><strong>An Applied Example Using Simulated (i.e., Fake) Data</strong></h3>
        <p>To make all of the pieces of ITS feel a bit more concrete, let&rsquo;s walk through a full example analyzing a realistic-ish policy intervention. This will give you a sense of how an ITS study works from beginning to end&mdash;what the data look like, how we build the variables, what the model estimates, and how we interpret the results.</p>
        <p>Imagine a state passed a naloxone access law that took effect on January 1, 2015 (intervention date). The goal of the law is straightforward: expand access to naloxone (the overdose-reversing medication) so that community members and first responders can intervene more quickly. Public health researchers and state agencies often want to know whether such policies reduce overdose deaths. ITS is an ideal design for answering that question because it is tied to a clear, meaningful, and well-timed intervention. Essentially, ITS will show whether the policy:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>had an immediate impact on overdoses, and</li>
            <li>changed the projected path of overdoses <em>in that state</em>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>In this example, we have monthly overdose death counts for the state from January 2010 through December 2020, giving us 132 total months of data. That&rsquo;s five full years before the law and six full years after&mdash;more than enough to establish a stable baseline pattern and assess whether the trajectory changed once the policy took effect.</p>
        <p>The data for this example is provided on the module page. The basic code is included below. We&rsquo;ll work through this in more detail in the lab, so don&rsquo;t stress if you&rsquo;re not getting it fully right now.</p>
        <h4><strong>Step 1: Load the Data and Plot the Outcome Over Time</strong></h4>
        <p>The first thing we do in ITS&mdash;just as with Regression Discontinuity&mdash;is load the data:</p>
        <p style="background-color: #eeeeee; padding: 10px; font-family: monospace; border-left: 4px solid #003366; text-align: center;">use "naloxone_its_example.dta", clear</p>
        <p>Because this data is &ldquo;time series&rdquo; data, we have to tell Stata that. Specifically, we do that by time setting the data (&ldquo;tsset&rdquo;) and then telling it what the time variable is called in our data. Our time variable is just called <em>time</em>. &nbsp;</p>
        <p style="background-color: #eeeeee; padding: 10px; font-family: monospace; border-left: 4px solid #003366; text-align: center;">tsset time</p>
        <p>Just with Regression Discontinuity based designs, it&rsquo;s helpful to visualize the data as well. When we graph the monthly overdose deaths from 2010 to 2014 (the pre-law period), we see a steady upward trend. There is some month-to-month fluctuation, but overall the pattern is rising in a fairly predictable way. This predictable trend is important because it becomes our baseline&mdash;our best estimate of where the outcome was heading before the law.</p>
        <p>When we look at the post-2015 period, something changes. There is a noticeable drop in overdose deaths immediately after the law is implemented, and the upward slope that characterized the pre-period becomes noticeably flatter. Visually, the line &ldquo;breaks&rdquo; right at the intervention date. This is exactly the kind of pattern we expect when a meaningful policy has an effect. Note my code is slightly fancier than yours, but you&rsquo;ll see basically the same thing.</p>
        <p style="background-color: #eeeeee; padding: 10px; font-family: monospace; border-left: 4px solid #003366; text-align: center;">twoway (scatter overdoses time) (lfit overdoses time if time &lt; 61) (lfit overdoses time if time &gt;= 61)</p>
        <h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong><img id="28912638" src="https://utk.instructure.com/courses/242597/files/28912638/preview" alt="Scatter plot of overdose deaths with trends and policy change indicator." width="624" height="374" data-api-endpoint="https://utk.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/242597/files/28912638" data-api-returntype="File" /></strong></h4>
        <h4><strong>Step 2: Construct the Key ITS Variables</strong></h4>
        <p>To formalize what we see in the graph, we build the three core ITS variables:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>time</strong>: a continuous count from 1 to 132 identifying each month</li>
            <li><strong>post</strong>: an indicator that equals 1 for months after January 2015 and 0 before</li>
            <li><strong>time &times; post</strong>: an interaction term that allows the slope to change after the policy</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This mirrors the running-variable logic we used in Regression Discontinuity, except now the running variable is <strong>time</strong> and the cutoff is the moment the law takes effect.</p>
        <p>These variables are already included in the dataset. In the lab, I&rsquo;ll show you how to construct this if it&rsquo;s not already there. 😊</p>
        <h4><strong>Step 3: Estimate the ITS Model</strong></h4>
        <p>We use the standard ITS regression:</p>
        <p style="text-align: center; background-color: #ffffff; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #ccc; font-family: monospace; font-size: 1.1em;">Y<sub>t</sub> = &alpha; + &beta;<sub>1</sub>(time) + &beta;<sub>2</sub>(post) + &beta;<sub>3</sub>(time &times; post) + &epsilon;<sub>t</sub></p>
        <p>Each part of this model corresponds to an interpretable feature of the trend:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>&beta;₁</strong>: the pre-policy slope</li>
            <li><strong>&beta;₂</strong>: the immediate level change when the law begins</li>
            <li><strong>&beta;₃</strong>: the change in slope after the law</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="background-color: #eee; padding: 10px; font-family: monospace; border-left: 4px solid #003366;">regress overdoses time post time_post, vce(robust)</p>
        <p>When we estimate this model, we get results roughly like:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>&beta;<sub>1</sub> &asymp; +0.80:</strong> Before the law, overdose deaths were rising by about 0.8 per month.</li>
            <li><strong>&beta;<sub>2</sub> &asymp; &ndash;9.48:</strong> When the law took effect, overdose deaths dropped by about 9.48 &nbsp;in that month.</li>
            <li><strong>&beta;<sub>3</sub> &asymp; &ndash;0.33:</strong> After the law, the monthly trend flattened by about 0.33 deaths per month.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Instead of continuing to rise at the pre-policy rate, the trend became less steep. These estimates closely match what we saw visually in the graph.</p>
        <h4><strong>Step 4: Interpreting the Results</strong></h4>
        <p>Putting these pieces together tells a coherent story:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Before the law, overdose deaths were steadily increasing.</li>
            <li>Immediately after the law took effect, deaths dropped sharply.</li>
            <li>Over time, the trend became much flatter, suggesting the problem wasn&rsquo;t escalating at the same pace.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This is exactly the kind of &ldquo;interruption&rdquo; ITS is designed to detect: a sudden shift plus a change in trajectory.</p>

        <h3><strong>Assumptions of the ITS Model</strong></h3>
        <p>Now that we&rsquo;ve walked through the naloxone example, we can step back and talk about what makes an ITS analysis credible. One of the reasons ITS is so appealing is that its core assumptions are intuitive&mdash;most of them reflect the way we naturally think about whether a policy &ldquo;worked.&rdquo; Still, there are some conditions that need to hold for the design to make sense, and it&rsquo;s useful to spell them out clearly.</p>
        <p>The first requirement is that the intervention happens at a clear moment in time. ITS depends on being able to say, &ldquo;this is when the policy began,&rdquo; and then looking to see whether the outcome changed right when it should have. If the intervention rolled out slowly or inconsistently&mdash;say, a program that gradually expanded over two years&mdash;it becomes very hard to define a single &ldquo;interruption.&rdquo; A good ITS setting is something like a statewide mandate that takes effect on January 1st, or a new regulation that starts being enforced immediately. If the moment of change itself is fuzzy, then the design&rsquo;s logic starts to fall apart.</p>
        <p>A second requirement is that the pre-intervention trend needs to be relatively stable. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be flat&mdash;many outcomes drift upward or downward over time&mdash;but it does need to follow a predictable pattern. This is because ITS uses that pre-policy trajectory as its best guess for what would have happened if the intervention hadn&rsquo;t occurred. If the trend is already bouncing around or breaking before the intervention starts, it&rsquo;s much harder to argue that any later change was caused by the policy itself.</p>
        <p>Another important condition is that nothing else major should happen at the same time as the intervention. If two big changes occur in the same month, we can&rsquo;t sort out which one caused which effect. For instance, if our naloxone law took effect during a sudden spike in fentanyl availability, it would be difficult to disentangle the influence of the policy from that external shock. ITS works best when the intervention is clean and not overshadowed by other events that are likely to affect the outcome.</p>
        <p>We also want to keep in mind that the outcome needs to be something that can respond quickly to the intervention. Policies that affect behavior&mdash;like emergency response systems, policing practices, or prescription access&mdash;are good candidates because they can produce immediate shifts. But some outcomes change slowly, like population health measures, institutional trust, or educational attainment. Those kinds of outcomes don&rsquo;t lend themselves as well to ITS because they don&rsquo;t show the sort of immediate or short-term changes that the method is built to capture.</p>
        <p>Lastly, because we&rsquo;re working with time-series data, the model often encounters autocorrelation, meaning that outcomes measured close together in time are highly related. This doesn&rsquo;t break the logic of ITS, but it does matter for standard errors. In real-world applications, analysts use settings (like Newey-West corrections) to handle this. In this class, we won&rsquo;t go into the technical details; it&rsquo;s enough to understand that autocorrelation is common and needs a bit of care.</p>
        <p>All of this leads to an important point: ITS is powerful, but it&rsquo;s also narrowly tailored. It tells us how <em>one specific intervention</em> affected <em>one specific unit</em> at <em>one specific moment</em>. That&rsquo;s exactly what many policy evaluations aim to do. But it also means ITS cannot answer broad social science questions about structural differences between units&mdash;questions like whether ideology affects policy preferences, or how community demographics shape trust in government. Those are not &ldquo;interruption&rdquo; questions, and forcing an ITS on them would be inappropriate. When the design fits, though, it fits beautifully.</p>

        <h3><strong>Extensions</strong></h3>
        <p>Even though this module focuses on the simplest version of Interrupted Time Series&mdash;a single unit experiencing a single intervention&mdash;there are more elaborate versions of ITS that show up in real-world policy work. We won&rsquo;t go deeply into them in this class, but it&rsquo;s helpful to know what&rsquo;s out there.</p>
        <p>One common extension is multiple-group ITS, sometimes referred to as <em>comparative ITS</em> or even as part of <em>event study</em> designs. In these cases, analysts have several states, agencies, cities, or organizations, each with its own time series. Some adopt the intervention earlier, some later, and some not at all. Rather than analyzing each one separately, researchers &ldquo;stack&rdquo; the data and estimate an average effect across all units. This version is especially useful when policymakers want to know whether an intervention tends to work across many contexts, not just one.</p>
        <p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;">There are also ITS models that incorporate seasonality (useful in fields like public health or employment), segmented regression approaches that allow for more than one interruption, and methods for handling complex error structures. These are widely used in applied work&mdash;especially in epidemiology, criminal justice, and public administration&mdash;but they go beyond what we need for this course. For our purposes, it&rsquo;s enough to know that the basic ITS logic scales up in flexible ways.</span></p>

        <h3><strong>Moving Forward</strong></h3>
        <p>At this point, you&rsquo;ve seen the core intuition behind ITS, you&rsquo;ve learned how to recognize when it&rsquo;s appropriate (and when it definitely isn&rsquo;t), and you&rsquo;ve walked through a full example using real code and data. The next step is to apply this yourself. In the lab for this module, we&rsquo;ll walk through an example in Stata, explore the fitted lines, and practice interpreting the coefficients from your model.</p>
        <p>As always, the goal isn&rsquo;t just to run the regression. It&rsquo;s to understand the story the data are telling: how the outcome was moving before the intervention, what changed when the policy started, and whether the pattern afterward makes sense given what we know about the world. If you can explain those elements clearly, then you&rsquo;re doing ITS well.</p>
